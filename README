prowlnotify Irssi Plugin
------------------------

prowlnotify is a simple script to send push notifications from Irssi to the
iPhone via Prowl (http://prowl.weks.net/).

It was originally based on BCOW's awayproxy.pl script which automatically marks
you as away when your last IRC client disconnects from Irssi's proxy. Given my
use of Irssi proxy, this was a perfect starting point.

By default, prowl will only send notifications when you are marked as away.
This behavior can be toggled using the /prowl command:

	/prowl auto	the default, send push notifications on away
	/prowl off	disable push notifications
	/prowl on	always send push notifications

Installation
------------

  1. Create a text file in ~/.prowlkey containing your Prowl API key.
  2. Copy the script into Irssi's scripts dir (typically ~/.irssi/scripts/)
  3. /script load prowlnotify.pl

TODO
----

  * Use Irssi's settings_get_str/settings_add_str functions for storing the
    prowl key?

  * Send push notifications on hilights (currently only private messages and
    mentions are pushed.
